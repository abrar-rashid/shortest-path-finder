# shortest-path-finder
A GUI-based visualiser for the Dijkstra and A* pathfinding algorithms, written in Python.

Usage:
1. Run main.py to open the menu.
2. Read the onscreen instructions to add/remove the start and end points, as well as any walls/barriers to restrict the path.
2. You will be prompted to then run the Dijkstra's or the A* algorithm.
